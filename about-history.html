                    <p>HandReach was established in 2002 by a group of graduate students in Communication at the University of Maryland. With limited resources, the students aimed to leverage their skills to create impactful educational initiatives in rural schools in China. Initially, HandReach provided microgrants to applicants with innovative project ideas, requiring full transparency and accountability in their funding usage. To date, these efforts have led to over 50 successful educational development projects across China.</p>

                    <p>In 2006, Brecken Chinn Swartz, founder of HandReach, encountered a young girl in Beijing who had severe burn injuries and was in dire need of medical attention. This encounter sparked a realization about the significant gap in access to quality care for children in developing countries who suffer from complex trauma injuries and lack the financial resources to receive the necessary treatment. In response to this pressing need, HandReach launched the Children's Healing Initiative (CHI) in 2007 to assemble a team of top medical professionals and provide life-changing care to children affected by burns and amputations, ultimately empowering them to regain their independence and lead productive lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>In May 2008, HandReach expanded its humanitarian efforts by launching the Sichuan Hope Project in partnership with 512Children.org, in response to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan Province that left thousands of children without limbs. This initiative not only addressed the critical needs of injured children but also aimed to support the reconstruction of a remote school that had been severely affected by the disaster and overlooked by formal relief efforts. Thanks to the generosity of HandReach donors, the school in Guanzhuan Town, Qingchuan County, has been restored to full functionality, enabling local children to continue their education. Guided by its mission, HandReach strives to ensure that no child worldwide, injured by trauma, is left without access to essential resources, education, and opportunities for a healthy, productive life.</p>
