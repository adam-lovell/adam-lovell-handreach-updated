                    <p>At the core of HandReach's mission is a dedication to transforming institutions by empowering their personnel with advanced expertise. To achieve this, HandReach organizes international training clinics that focus on surgical, rehabilitative, and psychosocial care, as well as sponsors joint conferences to facilitate the exchange of best practices among institutions. By fostering research and practice partnerships, HandReach aims to elevate the clinical skills of all care providers involved in pediatric trauma rehabilitation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Areas of clinical focus include:</strong></p>

                        <li><em>Surgery</em></li>

                <div>
                    <p>Each winter, HandReach assembles a team of skilled clinicians specializing in reconstructive surgery for a week-long international clinic. Together, they provide vital surgeries and develop personalized physical therapy plans to help pediatric burn survivors recover from severe scarring and contractures. Currently, our clinic is hosted by the China General Air Force Hospital in Beijing, with plans to expand to India, Indonesia, and Africa in the near future.</p>
                    <p>In January, HandReach led a team of hand surgery and rehabilitation experts to the China General Air Force Hospital in Beijing for a week-long Hand Clinic. Comprising two surgeons, three rehabilitation therapists, and one nurse, the team provided 85 surgical procedures and extensive individualized hand therapy to patients at the pediatric burn unit, totaling over $200,000 in free care. The team also trained two dozen Chinese hospital staff members, as well as patients' parents, and left behind valuable resources, including articles and procedures, to support ongoing training. If you're a clinician interested in joining us this winter, please contact Program Coordinator Brecken at <a href="mailto:brecken@handreach.org">brecken@handreach.org</a>.</p>

                    <p>Every summer, HandReach hosts a team of professionals specializing in the psychosocial healing of pediatric trauma survivors. This team is supported by the HandReach Beat Brigade, a multicultural group of young adults, to offer a summer camp experience for children recovering from burn injuries or amputations. The camp serves two purposes: direct support for child trauma survivors and training for adults working with trauma-injured children.</p>
                    <p>In 2010, HandReach led a 20-person team to two cities in China, providing a comprehensive program of therapeutic activities and clinical training for burn-injured children and staff. The team also donated essential equipment and supplies to the hospitals. Our current goal is to establish a Pediatric Trauma Survivor Society in Mainland China, supported by skilled clinicians from China and abroad. We aim to develop a small in-house prosthetics unit at the China General Air Force Hospital in Beijing, leveraging long-term support from Co-op students from medical colleges in Boston. If you're a clinician interested in joining us this summer, please send your CV to Program Coordinator Brecken at <a href="mailto:brecken@handreach.org">brecken@handreach.org</a>.</p>

                    <p>In January 2010, HandReach launched its co-op partnership with the Bouve College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University by hosting nursing student Kenneth Wong for a four-month clinical rotation at the China General Air Force Hospital. Wong's experience, which included assisting in nursing, physical therapy, and surgery, marked the beginning of HandReach's international training opportunities for health science students.</p>
                    <p>We're now offering similar programs and would welcome interested students to contact Program Coordinator Brecken at <a href="mailto:brecken@handreach.org">brecken@handreach.org</a> to learn more.</p>
