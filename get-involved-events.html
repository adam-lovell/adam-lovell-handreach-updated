                    <h3>Gala Charity Ball Featuring the Akoma Drummers, and The Gail Line</h3>
                    <p><strong>New Deal Cafe: 113 Greenbeltway, Greenbelt, MD</strong><br><strong>November 11, 2011, 8:00 PM – 11:00 PM</strong></p>
                    <p>The Akoma Drummers are a group of percussionists, singers and dancers who present a fusion of African drumming and chants for a unique spiritual experience. The group formed in the spring of 2010 when Kristen Brooks brought their talent, bands and students together to play the djembe and djun djun drums from the wall of origins, from West African Mandingue culture. A portion of the proceeds from the event went to help HandReach.</p>
                    <p>A big thank you to Kristen Brooks, The Gail Line, and the New Deal Cafe for their generosity. The Gail Line is a rootsy DC-based swing duo with wide-ranging influences that include R&B, Rockabilly, Western Swing, Jump Blues, and Gypsy Jazz. They have forged a sound that embraces music history without sounding antiquated. The Akoma Drummers proudly study and present music of the African diaspora - the origin of all people and all music. Our music comes from traditional West African to funk and GO-GO. We play djembe, kenkeni, sangba, and dun dun drums, and spice up our compositions with percussion, dancing and songs. AKOMA describes the Abyssinia (ancient Ethiopia) region and represents the HEART. Adaba is Ghanaian for THE HEAVEN. Put them all together, and it means "The Heaven in the Heart." The HandReach Beat Brigade is looking Up From Poverty.</p>
